The dataset includes 6389 images.
Masker are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 31 percent of the image
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 3 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
